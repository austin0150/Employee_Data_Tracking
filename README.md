# Employee_Data_Tracking
Small employee info tracking system to get some more experience with C# .NET Framework

This project is just something I used to learn the C# language and .NET framework. It's a small system to track fictional employee
data. It's designed using windows forms and interacts with a Microsoft SQL Server to store and retrieve data.

* Written in C# Using .NET Framework
* Designed with Windows Forms in Visual Studio
* Communicates with Microsoft SQL Server using SQL commands
